-- Get processor description from Windows Registry  (Query 1) (Processor Description)

-- Gives you the model number and rated clock speed of your processor(s)
-- Your processors may be running at less than the rated clock speed due

-- You can use CPU-Z to get your actual CPU core speed and a lot of other useful information
